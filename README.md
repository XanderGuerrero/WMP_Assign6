Submission in groups of 2

Introduction

Many client-server applications use a “listener” on the server side. The listener is often implemented as
a multi-threaded application. Essentially, it listens for a request from a client and creates a new thread
to handle that particular client’s request. As soon as it fires off the thread, the main thread returns to
“listening” mode.

Requirements

Build a Chat system that will allow two people to talk to one another on two different computers.
- You may use any IPC protocol
- You may create a forms solution or a console solution
- The chat must be supported between two computers
- Either person in the chat may end the chat session. When ended, the communication paths
must end gracefully.
- Although you are not required to have multiple clients supported, in a Word document, discuss
what you will need to do to your solution to make it support multiple clients.

Hand in, in one zipped folder:
- All solutions
- Word document with the required discussion
May be required to demonstrate during lab period on two separate computers.
